## InRux

This project is a work in progress to develop a microkernel OS based entirely on the Rux programming language.

The concepts are intended to present an operating system development that solves many of the shortcomings of operating system like Linux, BSD, and Windows.

Some of these shortcomings include application configuration management, application install and uninstall whether using official repositories or just custom installing an application from the internet there are always problems with removing these applications and managing security.
